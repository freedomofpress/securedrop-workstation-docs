SecureDrop Workstation Project Status
=====================================

SecureDrop Workstation is currently in active development.

We are currently in an open beta. If you are
interested in using SecureDrop Workstation, please reach out to us
via our `contact form <https://securedrop.org/help>`_.

Is SecureDrop Workstation right for you?
----------------------------------------

If you're a journalist or news organization trying to decide if this is right for you,
please note that SecureDrop Workstation should only be used
by organizations that meet the following criteria:

* You have an existing SecureDrop Server in place
* You typically only interact with .pdf, .doc, and .jpg files via your
  SecureDrop (as opposed to large datasets or complex file formats, which are
  :doc:`not yet supported <supported_filetypes>`)
* You have a functional *Secure Viewing Station* to fall back on
* Your journalists and support staff are comfortable trying a new operating
  system (Qubes OS), and are aware that they may need to troubleshoot with us
  or with your internal tech team if issues arise
* Your journalists don't rely on the features that are :doc:`not yet implemented <known_issues>`

If you do not meet the criteria above, you are likely to run into
difficulties or frustrating experiences using the Workstation, and should
consider waiting until it is more mature.

SecureDrop Workstation Feature Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SecureDrop Workstation provides a faster and more streamlined way of interacting
with sources and submissions, while preserving important security properties.
That said, it is still under development, and not all features available on the
Tails-based (existing) system are available in SecuredDrop Workstation. We are
working towards feature parity, but in the meantime, there are some notable differences;
see the :doc:`known_issues` page for more information.


Do you still need a Tails-based *Secure Viewing Station*?
---------------------------------------------------------

For now, yes. There are still circumstances where the SecureDrop Workstation
may not be able to retreive or show submissions. The main instances are
either in situations where there are a substantial number of sources or
submissions stored on the SecureDrop server, or in instances were you are
trying to open a file type that the Workstation is not yet equipped to handle.

Once SecureDrop Workstation is more mature, you will be able to use it to view
most submissions, but for now, having the *Secure Viewing Station* available
as a backup is imperative.
